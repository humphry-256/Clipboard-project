## My process
I started this by structuring all the HTML and adding links and necessary images. Based on the given design files, I then added the necessary classes and ids, having done that I proceeded to write the css staring with the classes or ids that shared the same properties then later sating working from top to bootom of the page and concluded with adding responsiveness using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
This being my first "serious"ðŸ˜… challenge. I have learnt a lot about the whole process of building a site. This project has helped me learn more about Version Control (Git and GitHub) and website deployment with Netlify. Obviously, I am no expert (yet ðŸ˜…) at both but I have learned a great deal. 

I used a bit of CSS Grid in the footer but mainly flex because I am still working on my grid layout skills.

Finally, CSS selectors also came in vey handy in building this project. I was frustrated with some properties not working( Typical CSSðŸ˜‚) but then reviewed the rules of the cascade and improved the selectors.

### Continued development

Still want to improve and get more comfortable with CSS grid layout

A very helpful technique is planning out the css prior to actual coding where I identified the elements that share properties. I also intend to keep on with this practice.
